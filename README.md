## Overview
This project is my solutio to the Frontend Mentor Recipe Page challenge. The goal was to build a clean, responsive recipe page using html and css while ensuring the design closely matches the guven reference.

I focused on layout consistency, spacing and typography. The project follows a desktop-first approach.

## My process
I started by structuring my files neatly, ensuring clear separation between assets, styles, and HTML. My goal was to follow a desktop-first approach, ensuring the layout looks great on larger screens before optimizing for smaller screens.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS custom properties  
- Desktop-first workflow 


### What I learned
My computer doesn't have all possible fonts and their respective styles. Learning how to reference external assets like fonts, icons, or images in css makes my projects more flexible.
Here's an example:
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Outfit Light';
    src: url('/assets/fonts/outfit/static/Outfit-Light.ttf');
}
```
